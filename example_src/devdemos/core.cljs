    ClojureScript Devcards are a tool to help you **quickly** surface what
    you are working on. This page holds an quick introduction to
    devcards.

    this like so:"

    hold almost any arbitrary functionality that you want." ))

   The cards on this page can be found in the file
   **example_src/devdemos/core.cljs**.  Please follow along in this file
   to see how these examples are created.

   If you ran `lein figwheel` to get this demo started, you can edit
   **example_src/devdemos/core.cljs** and see this page update when you save
   the file.

   I highly encourage you to poke and prod at the code you find on
   this page so you can experience how Devcards works.

   Go ahead and change this text to see the changes reflected here."))
